# LFS Management and Monitoring Dashboard

This project contains a CGI based dashboard that allows to monitor and do a certain set of configuration actions against a previously configured and build LFS System.

The solution uses the CGI-api to generate json payloads that are interactively used by the dasboard application to interact with the LFS system.
